# Hey! 👋 I'm Syed Muzammil Hussaini 🚀

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub - where code happens, caffeine flows, and wild ideas (sometimes) turn into cool projects.  
I'm a Computer Science Engineering student at **RV College of Engineering**, and a part-time software developer/engineer.

When I’m not busy wrestling with bugs at 2 AM, you’ll probably find me binge-watching movies, geeking out over documentaries, or dreaming up the next big thing in **sleep**.

## 🚧 Projects I'm Building (and Sometimes Breaking)

- **[MediTrack](https://github.com/syedmuzammil/Medi-Track):**  
  A health history tracker for hospitals -> because patients deserve better than "let me find your file from 2008."

- **[Process Management Simulator](https://github.com/syedmuzammil/Process-Simulator):**  
  Ever wondered what’s going on inside your OS? This project visualizes how processes fight for CPU time -> like a Royal Rumble, but with algorithms.

- **[CliniNSync](https://github.com/syedmuzammil/CliniNSync):**  
  Making hospital appointments less painful -> real-time scheduling, smarter patient tracking, and even an AI chatbot that doesn’t ghost you.
